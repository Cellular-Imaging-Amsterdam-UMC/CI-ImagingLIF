You're free to use this code in any way you like

The code is 99.99% Matlab, 0.01% c++ (github does not index it correctly). Or fully Matlab if you use the .m versions of xml2struct

The code is tested on Windows, so linux/mac users should probably have to change some parts of the code (changing \ in  /)
The xml2struct and xm2structstring MEX64 sources can be found in the xm2struct subfolder. Or use the slower m files (and change this in the code)

To the binary Windows release, download and install the Windows version of the MATLAB Runtime for R2022b
